The reason for creating this project is that [VerticallyButton](https://github.com/zeushin/VerticallyButton) seems to be no longer maintained. I submitted the PR, but it was not merged in time. Thanks to VerticallyButton achieve what I needed. So I developed and maintained this project on the basis of [VerticallyButton](https://github.com/zeushin/VerticallyButton).
